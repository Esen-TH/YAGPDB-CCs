# Configuration Variables

1. `$Suggestion_Channel` -

	The channel where the suggestions are sent.

2. `$Logging_Channel` - 

	The channel where messages regarding denied/approved/implemented and suggestions marked as dupe are sent. It us suggested to keep it separate from the $Suggestion_Channe to reduce clutter but depends on personal taste. 

3. `$Implemented_Channel` -
	
	The channel where suggestions which have been marked as implemented are sent. This provides a good way to organise all implemnted suggestions into a separate channel.
	
4. `$Approved_Channel` -
	
	The channel where suggestions which have been marked as approved are sent. This provides a good way to organise all approved suggestions. This provides a good way to organise all implemnted suggestions into a separate channel. It is very much possible to set the same channel for tracking approved+implemented suggestions by using the same channel id in both variables.

*Note:* Among the **above** variables all channels can be separate or same. All combinations are possible. For the server, all logging is set to one channel.


5. `$Mod_Roles` -

	List of all role ids of moderators who shpuld have access to all the suggestadmin commands. No need to specify roles who have `administrator` permissions in your server. They will have access by default.

6. `$Cooldown` -

	Colldown in seconds between consucutive suggestions. This prevents suggestion misuse/spam. Can be set to 0 to disable. Mods/Admins can bypass the cooldown. In the server, it is set to 0 for no cooldown time.

7. `$Upvote` -

	The emoji for upvote reaction "üëç".
	
8. `$Downvote` -

	The emoji for downvote reaction "üëé".
